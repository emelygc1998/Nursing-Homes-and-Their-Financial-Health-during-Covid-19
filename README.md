Our analysis utilized various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms such as
bar charts and box plots to visualize financial trends and distributions, helping us to see changes
over time and compare performance across states. Linear regression models helped us
understand the relationship between various factors, like regulatory changes and economic
conditions, and the net income of nursing homes. These models were crucial for identifying
direct influences on financial outcomes. Decision tree models allowed us to examine complex
interactions between multiple factors, offering a clearer view of how different variables impact
net incomes. Python was the primary programming language for this analysis, supported by
libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for
creating visualizations. We also used Scikit-learn for implementing and evaluating the machine
learning models, including linear regression, decision trees and random forest.
